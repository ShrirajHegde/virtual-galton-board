# Galton Board Simulation
### Monte-Carlo simulation of Galton Board  which demonstrates Central Limit Theorem and Binomial Distribution

Simulating and animating galton board which demonstrates central limit theorem in a beautiful manner. Here, the "beads" and let down and they bounce left and righ with the same probability of 0.5 . Equal number of left and right bunces are the most probable which makes the centermost position highly likely and so on while all left or right bounces are very less likely.
